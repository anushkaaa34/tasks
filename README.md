hello! This is Anushka Sinha 
I'm pursuing my B.tech degree in civil engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati.
I'm from Sagar district of Madhya Pradesh. Now coming to my extra co-curricular activities, I am classically trained in Kathak(completed 6 year course) and pretty much interested in fine arts.
