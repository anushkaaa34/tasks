hello! This is Anushka Sinha 
I'm pursuing my B.tech degree in civil engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati.
I'm from Sagar district of Madhya Pradesh. Now coming to my extra co-curricular activities, I am classically trained in Kathak(completed 6 year course) and pretty much interested in fine arts.
open source projects are great way to learn how to look at a problem from different perspective and opportunity to learn from each other.
when you contribute to an open sourc project you're giving back to community at large not only this helps us hone our skills but it also allows us to get better at reciving feedback.
